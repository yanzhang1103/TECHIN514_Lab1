Proximity-Based Alert & Visualization System

A two-device proximity sensing system that detects how close an object or person is and provides intuitive physical feedback through a gauge needle and LED indicators. The system focuses on translating continuous proximity data into stable, non-screen-based feedback that can support spatial awareness and proximity alerts.

1. Sensor Device: Handheld Proximity Sensor

The sensor device is a compact, handheld proximity-sensing unit designed to detect nearby objects and transmit processed proximity data wirelessly to a separate display device. It emphasizes directional sensing and portable, battery-powered operation.

Hardware Components

Microcontroller: ESP32-C3 (Bluetooth Low Energy)

Distance Sensor: Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F infrared distance sensor

Status Indicator: LED

Battery: 3.7V LiPo battery

Power Control: Slide switch

How It Works

The infrared distance sensor continuously measures the distance between the device and nearby objects. The ESP32-C3 samples the analog sensor output and applies basic digital signal processing, including smoothing and thresholding, to reduce noise and generate a stable proximity level. This processed proximity data is transmitted to the display device using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

Power Design

The sensor device is battery-powered using a 3.7V LiPo battery. Low-power operation is supported through intermittent sampling and BLE communication, making the device suitable for portable use.

2. Display Device: Proximity Gauge Display

The display device is a standalone physical interface that visualizes proximity information received from the sensor device. It provides continuous, intuitive feedback through a moving gauge needle and LED indicators.

Hardware Components

Microcontroller: ESP32-C3

Actuator: Stepper motor driving a gauge needle

Motor Driver: ULN2003

Visual Indicator: LED

User Input: Physical button / switch

Battery: 3.7V LiPo battery

How It Works

The display device receives proximity data from the sensor device via BLE. The ESP32-C3 maps the received proximity value to a corresponding needle angle and controls the stepper motor to move the gauge needle accordingly. LEDs provide additional status feedback, such as indicating safe or alert proximity ranges.

User Interaction

A physical button or switch allows basic user interaction, such as powering the device on or switching operating modes. The display continuously reflects proximity changes without requiring screen-based interaction.

3. System Architecture
3.1 Communication Diagram

The system consists of two independent, battery-powered devices connected via Bluetooth Low Energy. The sensor device acts as the BLE server, while the display device functions as the BLE client, receiving proximity updates in real time.
