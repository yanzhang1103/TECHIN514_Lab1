Proximity Gauge

Proximity Gauge is a two-device system that senses how close an object is and visualizes that proximity using a physical gauge. A handheld sensing device measures distance using an infrared sensor and wirelessly sends a processed proximity level to a separate gauge display, where a stepper-motor-driven needle and LEDs provide intuitive, non-screen-based feedback.

General physical form:
The system consists of a compact handheld sensing device shaped like a professional measurement tool, and a standalone circular gauge display. The sensing device features a front-facing IR sensor window, a small status LED, and a USB power port. The display device includes a circular dial with a moving needle, indicator LEDs, and a physical switch for power or mode control.
